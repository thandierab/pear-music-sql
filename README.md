## Part 3: Subqueries and Joins with SQL

#### 1. Using a subquery, find the names of all the tracks for the album "Californication".

```SQL
select tracks.name, albums.title
from tracks
join albums on albums.albumid = tracks.albumid
where albums.title in (select title from albums where title like '%cali%');
```

#### 2. Find the total number of invoices for each customer along with the customer's full name, city and email.

```SQL
SELECT
    COUNT(invoices.invoiceid) AS invoice_count,
    (customers.firstname || ' ' || customers.lastname) AS fullname,
    customers.city,
    customers.email
FROM
    customers
JOIN
    invoices ON customers.customerid = invoices.customerid
GROUP BY
    customers.customerid, fullname, customers.city, customers.email;
```

#### 3. Retrieve the track name, album, artistID, and trackID for all the albums.

```SQL
select tracks.name, albums.title, albums.artistid, tracks.trackid
from tracks
join albums on albums.albumid = albums.albumid
group by tracks.trackid, tracks.name;
```

#### 4. Retrieve a list with the managers last name, and the last name of the employees who report to him or her.

```SQL
SELECT
    e1.LastName AS EmployeeLastName,
    e2.LastName AS ManagerLastName
FROM
    employees e1
LEFT JOIN
    employees e2 ON e1.ReportsTo = e2.EmployeeId;
```

#### 5. Find the name and ID of the artists who do not have albums.

```SQL
SELECT
    artists.ArtistId,
    artists.Name
FROM
    artists
LEFT JOIN
    albums ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
WHERE
    albums.AlbumId IS NULL;
```

#### 6. Use a UNION to create a list of all the employee's and customer's first names and last names ordered by the last name in descending order.

```SQL
Select customers.firstname, customers. lastname
from customers
union
select employees.firstname, employees.lastname
from employees
order by lastname desc;
```

#### 7. See if there are any customers who have a different city listed in their billing city versus their customer city.

```SQL
select invoices.customerid, invoices.billingaddress, invoices.billingcity, customers.city
from invoices
join customers on customers.customerid = invoices.customerid;
```

## Part 4: Modyfying and Analyzing Data with SQL

#### 1. Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

```SQL
select
customerid,
(firstname || ' ' || lastname) as FullName,
UPPER(city || ' ' || country) as Location

from customers;
```

Note: only the first 16 records have been displayed.

#### 2. Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.

```SQL
select employeeid, (firstname || ' ' || lastname) as fullname,
lower(substr(firstname, 1,4) || substr(lastname,1,2)) as userid
from employees;
```

    employees
where years_diff >= 15
ORDER BY
    lastname;
